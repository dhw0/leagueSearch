# leagueSearch
Old search application I made for League of Legends

Setup: Download all the files, then compile. Should work without anything extra due to use of classpath.

Disclaimer: The actual search function may not work anymore, since Riot updated their API sometime after I wrote this. Likely will not be updated due to loss of interest in game.
